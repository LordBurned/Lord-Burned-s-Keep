                    About the game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first game project, and while I’m not an amazing artist or programmer yet, I believe everyone has to start somewhere. 
                    My vision is to create a unique blend of cyberpunk and fantasy, set in a universe where humanity has expanded across the stars. 
                    The game will be a single-player RPG with strategic elements, combining deep storytelling, character development, and tactical decision-making.
                    Drawing inspiration from games like <span class="highlight">Warhammer</span> and <span class="highlight">Rimworld</span>, I aim to craft a rich, immersive world filled with complex characters, moral dilemmas, and a mix of futuristic technology and mystical elements. 
                    It’s an ambitious project, but I’m excited to learn, grow, and share every step of this journey with you. 
                    Let’s see where this takes us!

                <h2>

                <div class="container_list">
                    <p>
                        I’m using <span class="highlight">Aseprite</span> for the pixel art, and while it’s a paid tool, I believe it’s worth every penny. 
                        Its intuitive interface, powerful features, and focus on pixel art make it a fantastic choice for creating the visuals for my game. 
                        That said, I know there are free alternatives available online for those who prefer not to invest right away. 
                        If you’re serious about pixel art, I highly recommend giving it a try!

                        For the game engine, I’m using <span class="highlight">Godot</span>, which is not only free but also incredibly versatile and user-friendly. 
                        Its simplicity makes it perfect for someone like me who’s still learning the ropes of game development, while its powerful features. 
                        It’s open-source nature and supportive community have been a huge help.
                        If you’re looking for a game engine that’s both accessible and robust, Godot is definitely worth checking out!
